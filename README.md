# Ludo_Game

Ludo: Ludo is a simple, luck-based game that can be a fun project for learning C programming and handling random events.
Developing a complete Ludo game in C programming can be a comprehensive project, and providing the entire code here would be too lengthy. 
However, this is a simplified version of a text-based Ludo game in C to get started. 
This code provides the basic structure and logic for a two-player game. We can expand and enhance it as needed.

In this simplified Ludo code, I have a basic text-based representation of a Ludo board. Players take turns rolling a die, and their positions are updated accordingly. The game continues until one of the players reaches or surpasses position 52 (the finish line).

Please note that this is just a starting point, and we can enhance the game by adding more features, such as rules for safe zones, special tiles, and win conditions, and by implementing a better user interface.
